		<p class="title">Chapter 20</p>
		<p class="author">I had begun to understand that we had lent our voices to a discourse whose sole purpose was to dehumanize and brutalize othersâ€”because nurturing that discourse was easier, because retaining power always feels like the way forward.</p>
		<p>Chapter 23<br>Days later, when it was confirmed that I was not pregnant, I evolved a new understanding of the word "whore," one that was less about actions and more about essence. It was not that I had done something wrong as much as that I existed in the wrong way. There was something impure in the fact of my being.<br>It's strange how you give the people you love so much power over you, I had written in my journal. But Shawn had more power over me than I could possibly have imagined. He had defined me to myself, and there's no greater power than that.</p>
		<p>Chapter 24<br>I had a thousand dollars in my bank account. It felt strange just to think that, let alone say it. A thousand dollars. Extra. That I did not immediately need. It took weeks for me to come to terms with this fact, but as I did, I began to experience the most powerful advantage of money: the ability to think of things besides money.</p>
